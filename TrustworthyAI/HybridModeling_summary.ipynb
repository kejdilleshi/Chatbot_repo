        "Hybrid modeling combines the strengths of data-driven Machine Learning (ML) techniques with traditional scientific or physics-based models. This paradigm aims to overcome the limitations of both \"black-box\" ML models and purely theoretical approaches. ML-only models (data-only) are highly effective in commercial applications but often fail in scientific domains due to their inability to generalize well with limited data or adhere to established scientific principles. Conversely, traditional scientific models, while grounded in theory, may be limited by computational inefficiencies or incomplete representations of complex phenomena.\n",

        "Figure 1.1 provides a framework to contextualize hybrid modeling within the broader concept of KGML. The horizontal axis illustrates the use of data, while the vertical axis represents reliance on scientific knowledge. Traditional ML approaches emphasize data (lower-right quadrant), whereas scientific models rely solely on domain knowledge (upper-left quadrant). Hybrid modeling—central to KGML—occupies the upper-right quadrant, leveraging both data and theory to create models that are both scientifically consistent and capable of generalizing from data."

        "### Why Use Hybrid Models?\n",
        "The motivation for using hybrid models stems from the limitations of relying solely on either physics-based models or ML. Physics-based models are grounded in known laws, ensuring that their results are consistent with our understanding of the world, but they require detailed parameterization and are not always practical in data-limited settings. Conversely, ML models excel at learning from large datasets, but their predictions may violate fundamental principles without some form of guidance.\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining these two approaches, hybrid models offer the following advantages:\n",
        "- **Improved accuracy**: ML can learn residual patterns or unknown processes that a physics-based model might miss.\n",
        "- **Physical consistency**: The inclusion of physical laws helps prevent ML from making predictions that violate established principles.\n",
        "- **Reduced computational costs**: ML can be used to approximate or accelerate parts of the model, reducing the computational demands of complex simulations.\n",
        "- **Enhanced interpretability**: Physics-based constraints ensure that the model remains interpretable, which is critical in scientific applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, hybrid models are not without challenges. The integration of physics and ML requires careful balance and may introduce complexity in model training, particularly in ensuring that the ML component adheres to physical laws. Additionally, hybrid models may still rely on large datasets for training, which can be a limitation in data-scarce regions.\n",

        "- **Climate science**: For modeling complex processes like glacier flow, ocean currents, or atmospheric dynamics.\n",
        "- **Engineering**: In systems where physical laws are well-known but ML can help optimize performance or reduce simulation time.\n",
        "- **Medical sciences**: Combining physiological models with ML to predict outcomes in complex biological systems.\n",
